## Project Title:
 Implementation and Analysis of Ring Oscillator-based PUF on Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 and Intel Altera FPGAs

## Project Description:
This project aims to design and implement a Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) using
 Ring Oscillator (RO) architectures on two FPGA platforms: the Xilinx PYNQ-Z1 and Intel
 Altera FPGA boards. PUFs are lightweight hardware security primitives that exploit process
 variations in silicon to generate unique and unpredictable device identifiers. These can be used for
 secure applications such as key generation, device authentication, and tamper detection.
